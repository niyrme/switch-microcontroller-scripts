# switch microcontroller scripts

A repo containing my scripts running on the base of [this](https://github.com/asottile/switch-microcontroller)

## Requirements
- Everything from the repo linked above (buzzer is optional)
- Python (I'm using 3.9, but 3.8+ _should_ work)
- A capture card (to get a video signal from the Switch to the PC)


# How to use
1. Rename `sample.config.json` to `config.json`
2. Update the settings in `config.json` (if so desired)
3. Run any of the packages as python modules: `python3 -m pokemon.bdsp`
	- add `-h` or `--help` as an argument to get a bit more info about each script (example: `python3 -m pokemon.bdsp --help <script>`)
